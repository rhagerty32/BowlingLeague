# 🎳 BYU Bowling League: The Holiest Strike 🎳

Welcome to the most *celestial* bowling league management system ever created.  
Built with ASP.NET, React, and **pure Cougar spirit.** 🏆💙

---

## 🏛️ Why Does This Exist?  
BYU students needed **a higher purpose** in their bowling—so we built a system to track their sacred strikes and fallen pins.  
Because **"Enter to Learn, Go Forth to Bowl."** (or something like that.)

## 🛠 Project Breakdown  
This project is divided into two glorious parts:

1. **Backend (ASP.NET Core API) 📡**  
   - Runs on the power of **Divine Intervention** (and C#).  
   - Stores all bowler-related knowledge (like how often they throw it in the gutter).  
   - Uses SQLite because we’re *humble stewards* of our database resources.  

2. **Frontend (React) 💻**  
   - Displays bowler stats **faster than Cosmo can crowd-surf.**  
   - Uses React and Tailwind, because **we believe in modern web frameworks.**  
   - Compatible with **all devices… except your flip phone from 2008.**
